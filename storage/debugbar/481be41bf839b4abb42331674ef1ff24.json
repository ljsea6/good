The eXplorist 350H includes a calendar to identify the best days and time to hunt based on moon phases and solunar positioning. Sunrise and sunset times are also available to help plan your hunt. As you enter your hunting grounds use the over 30 hunt specific waypoints to mark animal tracks, trail camera locations and build a database of what is happening in your hunting area. No more typing out names; use the waypoint icons to mark streams, bedding areas, food sources, game tracks and more. In addition to DigitalGlobe satellite imagery the 350H includes a detailed base map with contour elevation overlays showing roads, trails, water bodies and identifies terrain features for easier navigation in the backcountry. The eXplorist 350H comes with pre-loaded GMU\u2019s and WMU\u2019s to help you stay within legal hunt borders.
