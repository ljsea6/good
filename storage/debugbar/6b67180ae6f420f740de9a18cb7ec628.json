The Bradley Grill 4-Burner with Sear Burner gives you all the power and versatility you need for backyard entertaining and gives you a high heat infrared searing burner to create beautifully seared meats that lock in the juices for the most flavorful results. Big enough to cook for 4-6 people with 696 square inches of grill space (493 square inches primary and 203 square inches secondary) and a total of 55 000 BTU. Three individually controlled main burners aligned front-to-back plus a 4th infrared searing burner gives you the versatility you need to obtain a quick sear grill over direct heat or set up with indirect heat.

Cooking grates are cast-iron; designed to give beautiful grill marks. Hood is a double-layer design to hold in heat with porcelain enamel on the outside and aluminum plating on the inside.
