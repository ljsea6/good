The RRT26 is extremely durable because of the aircraft-grade aluminum body, which has been Type III hard-anodized, leaving you with an anti-abrasive finish. That means you can drop it from up to 1.5 meters or dunk it in water without ever having to worry. Now what makes the RRT26 so special is its RRT magnetic control ring, which gives you rapid access to 7 output modes. Whether you are mounting the RRT26 to a weapon for hunting, camping, hiking, or just want an awesome light that will never let you down, the RRT26 is the way to go. The RRT26 is equipped with the latest XM-L2 LED from CREE and red, green, and blue secondary LEDs. Accessing the 7 different outputs is done via the RRT magnetic control ring. You can go from 0 to 980 lumens in no time with a twist of the ring. You can also access the red, green, and blue LEDs, turbo mode, strobe, police strobe, and the standby power indicator mode. The intelligent memory function remembers your last output setting, so there are no surprises. Now that is true versatility. The stainless-steel bezel protects the head of the light from impacts and can be used for any defensive situation and can be removed if need be. You can also use the RRT26 in candle mode, as the flat tail end allows for standing it up right. Powering the RRT26 are either two CR123A\/RCR123A batteries or a single 18650 battery.Jetbeam RRT26 Rechargeable Flashlight<p><u>Condition<\/u> : This item is brand new, unopened and sealed in its original factory box.<\/p>', '2017-09-11 06:21:43', 'jetbeam-rrt26-rechargeable-flashlight', '10149030721', '{\"id\":23831521921,\"product_id\":10149030721,\"position\":1,\"created_at\":\"2017-09-11T06:21:43-05:00\",\"updated_at\":\"2017-09-11T06:21:43-05:00\",\"width\":1000,\"height\":1000,\"src\":\"https:\\\/\\\/cdn.shopify.com\\\/s\\\/files\\\/1\\\/1935\\\/1047\\\/products\\\/NWMNA-9007113.jpg?v=1505128903\",\"variant_ids\":[37786098433]}', '[{\"id\":23831521921,\"product_id\":10149030721,\"position\":1,\"created_at\":\"2017-09-11T06:21:43-05:00\",\"updated_at\":\"2017-09-11T06:21:43-05:00\",\"width\":1000,\"height\":1000,\"src\":\"https:\\\/\\\/cdn.shopify.com\\\/s\\\/files\\\/1\\\/1935\\\/1047\\\/products\\\/NWMNA-9007113.jpg?v=1505128903\",\"variant_ids\":[37786098433]}]', '[{\"id\":12232863745,\"product_id\":10149030721,\"name\":\"Title\",\"position\":1,\"values\":[\"Default Title\"]}]', 'Mascotas y Hobbies', '2017-09-11 06:21:42', 'global', 'Otros Hobbies', '', 'Jetbeam RRT26 Rechargeable Flashlight', '', '', '2017-09-11 06:21:43', '[{\"id\":37786098433,\"product_id\":10149030721,\"title\":\"Default Title\",\"price\":\"434689.00\",\"sku\":\"NWMNA-9007113\",\"position\":1,\"grams\":399,\"inventory_policy\":\"deny\",\"compare_at_price\":null,\"fulfillment_service\":\"manual\",\"inventory_management\":\"shopify\",\"option1\":\"Default Title\",\"option2\":null,\"option3\":null,\"created_at\":\"2017-09-11T06:21:43-05:00\",\"updated_at\":\"2017-09-11T06:21:43-05:00\",\"taxable\":true,\"barcode\":\"6957883800668\",\"image_id\":23831521921,\"inventory_quantity\":24,\"weight\":0.399,\"weight_unit\":\"kg\",\"old_inventory_quantity\":24,\"requires_shipping\":true}]', 'Jetbeam') returning \"id\"","type":"query","params":[],"bindings":["The RRT26 from JETBeam is a truly versatile and powerful LED flashlight that has an output mode for any situation.
