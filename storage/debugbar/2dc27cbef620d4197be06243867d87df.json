The RRT-0 has been modified to its SE configuration, and features a new LED and interface. The RRT-0 SE has the SOS at its own mode instead of being hidden like the previous model. This makes accessing the SOS mode much easier. Switching modes is accomplished using JETBeams Rapid Response Control Ring, meaning you can get to your desired setting rapidly and easily. The RRT-0 SE uses either primary or rechargeable CR123A batteries or can be fitted with widely available and inexpensive AA batteries. The RRT-0 SE is equipped with the latest XM-L2 LED from CREE and outputs a very bright 730 lumens while in high mode. You can cycle down through the different output modes via the rapid response control ring and make your way to the 3-lumen firefly mode. That is perfect if you need a subtle light while camping and reading or if you need to find you way around an area without making too much commotion. You can stay in firefly mode for up to 45 hours. Again, SOS now has its own mode, instead of being hidden, making it easier to access in emergency situations. Powering the RRT-0 SE is either one CR123A\/RCR123A batteries or one AA battery. You dont have to worry about inserting the batteries the wrong way, as there is reverse polarity protection. The RRT-0 SE is waterproof to IPX-8 standards meaning you can dunk the light under water up to 2 meters for 30 minutes with no damage to the batteries or the light.Jetbeam RRT0SE LED Flashlight Black<p><u>Condition<\/u> : This item is brand new, unopened and sealed in its original factory box.<\/p>', '2017-09-11 06:19:36', 'jetbeam-rrt0se-led-flashlight-black', '10149022337', '{\"id\":23831511361,\"product_id\":10149022337,\"position\":1,\"created_at\":\"2017-09-11T06:19:36-05:00\",\"updated_at\":\"2017-09-11T06:19:36-05:00\",\"width\":1000,\"height\":1000,\"src\":\"https:\\\/\\\/cdn.shopify.com\\\/s\\\/files\\\/1\\\/1935\\\/1047\\\/products\\\/NWMNA-9005677.jpg?v=1505128776\",\"variant_ids\":[37786088641]}', '[{\"id\":23831511361,\"product_id\":10149022337,\"position\":1,\"created_at\":\"2017-09-11T06:19:36-05:00\",\"updated_at\":\"2017-09-11T06:19:36-05:00\",\"width\":1000,\"height\":1000,\"src\":\"https:\\\/\\\/cdn.shopify.com\\\/s\\\/files\\\/1\\\/1935\\\/1047\\\/products\\\/NWMNA-9005677.jpg?v=1505128776\",\"variant_ids\":[37786088641]}]', '[{\"id\":12232852673,\"product_id\":10149022337,\"name\":\"Title\",\"position\":1,\"values\":[\"Default Title\"]}]', 'Mascotas y Hobbies', '2017-09-11 06:19:36', 'global', 'Camping', '', 'Jetbeam RRT0SE LED Flashlight Black', '', '', '2017-09-11 06:19:36', '[{\"id\":37786088641,\"product_id\":10149022337,\"title\":\"Default Title\",\"price\":\"414830.00\",\"sku\":\"NWMNA-9005677\",\"position\":1,\"grams\":304,\"inventory_policy\":\"deny\",\"compare_at_price\":null,\"fulfillment_service\":\"manual\",\"inventory_management\":\"shopify\",\"option1\":\"Default Title\",\"option2\":null,\"option3\":null,\"created_at\":\"2017-09-11T06:19:36-05:00\",\"updated_at\":\"2017-09-11T06:19:36-05:00\",\"taxable\":true,\"barcode\":\"6957883800729\",\"image_id\":23831511361,\"inventory_quantity\":16,\"weight\":0.304,\"weight_unit\":\"kg\",\"old_inventory_quantity\":16,\"requires_shipping\":true}]', 'Jetbeam') returning \"id\"","type":"query","params":[],"bindings":["JETBeam has been making upgrades to their most popular of flashlights.
